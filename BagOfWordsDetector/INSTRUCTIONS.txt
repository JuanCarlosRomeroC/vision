Using the Program
=================

From the directory with the file __main__.py, run the following command:

>>   python . <MODE> (<argument>)

MODE can be one of following four strings: train, predict, predict_all, ROC

	* train - trains with default parameters, and using the images in the pos and neg folders,
		and saves the classifier to a file motorcycleDetector.pkl, so that it can be loaded later.

		Should take about one minute.

		The output of this command is a description of the steps that the program does while
		preparing the classifier. Only the time-consuming steps are printed.

	* predict - takes the given <argument> paramter, a path to an image and returns True or False, 
		indicating if the image is predicted to be a motorcycle or not. 
		Loads the classifier from the motorcycleDetector.pkl file.

		Should take a few seconds.

	* predict_all - predicts all the images in the test_pos and test_neg directories.

		Should take about one minute.

		The output of this command is a list stating which images were predicted to have motorcycles
		and which images were predicted not to have motorcycles. Finally, the program outputs the
		precision/recall values achieved.

	* predict_dir - predict_dir takes all the images in the directory specified by the <argument> parameter, 
		and outputs the prediction for each one (whether it has a motorcycle or not). It later outputs 
		the percentage of images that were predicted to have a motorcycle.

		Loads the classifier from the motorcycleDetector.pkl file.
	
	* ROC - trys various values for classifier parameters, and trains the classifier with each couple
		of parameters. After each training, all the images are predicted, and the precision/recall
		values are outputted. 

		Finally, a graph is plotted with all the precision/recall values gathered.

		This mode may take a few hours to run because the classifier takes time to train, and
		is trained with many different combinations of parameters.
