Using the Program
==========================

This module allows the user to interactively build a 3D-model of an input image, and then calculate the height of
different objects in the image based on one known height.

Usage:
    python run.py <img_path>

After the image has loaded, you may start marking lines in the image. Four different marking types are needed:
* '1' - Lines that in reality are parallel to one another and parallel to the ground.
        These lines should not be parallel in the image.
* '2' - Lines that in reality are parallel to one another and parallel to the ground, and not parallel to '1'
        These lines should not be parallel in the image.
* 'v' - Lines that are vertical in reality
* 'k' - A known-height object. This is an object in the image with a known height.
        When you mark this object, ALWAYS mark the BOTTOM first and then the top.

By pressing on the keyboard on one of the above characters, you will enter the relevant marking mode. After you have
chosen a mode, you can draw lines by clicking on where the line should start, and then clicking on where the line
should end. At any time, you may press the character 'z', which will allow you to zoom. After you press 'z', your
pen will turn gray, and you will be able to mark a rectangle to zoom to on the image. To zoom back out, press the
character 'z' again.

After you have marked all four types, you will be able to measure heights in the image. Press the character 'u',
that stands for "unknown size" (as opposed to the known size 'k'). Then mark the object you would like to measure.
Notice - when you mark this object, ALWAYS mark the BOTTOM first and then the top.

After measuring everything you every wished to measure, press ESC to exit the application.
