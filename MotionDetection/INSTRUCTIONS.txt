Using the Program
=================

Usage:
    python tracker.py [options]

Options:
    -v <video_path>     A path from the current directory to the input video. Default value: ./input/Highway1.mp4
    -b <bg_path>        A path from the current directory to an image file with a background model that fits the
                        input video. Default value: ./input/background.jpg, fits the given video files Highway1.mp4,
                        Highway3.mp4, Highway4.mp4.
                        Notice: using AVI files are problematic on some systems.
    --hide-blobs        If this parameter is used, the window showing the current frame's vehicle blobs is not
                        shown. In default, this window is shown.
    --fbf               Frame-by-frame. This changes the mode from video mode to manual mode. Moving between the
                        video frames stops being automatic, and a keypress (i.e. spacebar) is needed to continue to
                        the next frame.
    -l <height>         The height of the counting-line. This is a floating point number between 0 and 1, exclusive.
                        It measures the distance from the top of the video, where a line will be, and every vehicle
                        that passes the line will be counted. After each frame, the number of vehicles that have
                        already passed the line will be outputted to the screen.
                        The default value for this parameter is 0.7, and values under 0.7 are discouraged because
                        the vehicles are far away and in some cases multiple vehicles appear as one. The best values
                        for this parameter are between 0.7 and 0.9 .
    -h, --help          Display this help and exit
